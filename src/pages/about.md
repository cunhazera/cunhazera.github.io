Greetings from ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

I'm Cunha. Christian, husband, father and software engineer (in this order).

I've been around for over 10 years now, working as a backend engineer with focus in Java and JVM-languages applications, with experiences in traditional tech companies and startups in Brazil and USA.
